## Javascript 2 

## **Project Description**  
This project is a front-end application for a social media platform built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to:  
- Register and log in  
- Create, read, update, and delete posts (CRUD operations)  
- Follow and unfollow users  
- Search for posts  
- View user profiles  

The application integrates Noroff’s API for authentication and social content. It follows modular ES6 practices, with at least three functions documented using JSDoc. A basic UI is implemented, and the project is deployed on GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel.  

The code is structured and formatted according to best practices, with regular commits and the use of GitHub Issues for bug tracking.
