## **Project Description**

This project is a front-end application for a social media platform built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to:

- Register and log in
- Create, read, update, and delete posts
- Follow and unfollow users
- Search for posts
- View user profiles and search for profiles

The application integrates Noroff’s API for authentication and social content. It follows modular ES6 practices, with at least three functions documented using JSDoc. A basic UI is implemented, and the project is deployed on Netlify: https://javascript2-marengs.netlify.app/
